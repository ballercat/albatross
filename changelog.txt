0.0.3a -> 0.0.4a

    Version name 'Bowhead' to 'Finback'
        -Split up rendering into two cores
        -Switched to using OpenGL 1.5 core(for speed of development reasons)
        -Added merc sprites
        -Added jet sprites
        -Added double jumping
        -Fixed Game Loop & Timestep problems once and for all(for now)
            Physics code now runs at a constant timestep and is
            deterministic
            It's possible to run the game with nearly any fps and
            experience no physics/update slowdown
        -Added .ini handling with SimpleIni library
        -Diverted most settings into a .ini files
        -Fixed input resonse
        -Fine tuned controlls. Nothing is tied to framerate anymore.
        -Simplified Character class state handling. More complex 
            actions are handled in the Player-class and are broken 
            down and passed down to the underlying character-class
        -Fined tuned physics handling, there is still an acceptable
            level of 'failed' collisions.
